# Compliment-generator
Code for the Arduino Compliment generator I made 

This is how i programmed a Compliment Generator for my significant other using an Arduino, a button, and an LCD. Feel free to expand upon this project.
There are many ways to take it one step further. For example, you could make it print out the compliment on a piece of paper as opposed to on a screen,
or you could make it actually say the compliment out loud. Cool stuff.
